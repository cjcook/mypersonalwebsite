# mypersonalwebsite

This is the repository that contains all the code for my entire website which is hosted at (https://www.chrisjcook.net/).
The building process for this website was certainly a learing experience for me. I had to overcome many challenges when
designing and implementing the code for this site. One of the first challenges that I had was actually hosting the website
and getting it to display on the internet. After taking a web development course I was able to host my own website. Another
challenge that I had while developing the code, was getting my website to have multiple pages. It turns out website features
such as the navbar and footer, need to be copied over to each new page on a static website. This website was built as a platform
where I could express myself as a developer. It acts as a source where companies or individuals can reach out to me. Every professional
document that I have created this year has helped me shapte my website
the exact way that I want it.
